# cuteShop
A cute shop for XBMC4Xbox.

![](default.tbn)

## How to Use:
- Install the latest release of cuteShop
- Extract cuteShop and edit the default.py file out the ROOT_URL, API_URL and FILE_URL (secret as of right now!)
- Copy the cuteShop folder to "Q:/scripts"
- Run cuteShop, and enter your Rapid Access Code (can be found on the cuteShop website for each available game!)
- ???
- Profit!
- (Optional) To edit settings such as download folder, background downloading, or change the on-screen keyboard, etc, you can edit the settings in Plugin Settings!

## TODO:
- Increase download performance without sacrificing stability
- Background download mode (probably unstable, but may download with a smaller chunk size to take into account memory usage from media or whatever)
- Explore all available Rapid Access Codes via API.
- Better UI design?
